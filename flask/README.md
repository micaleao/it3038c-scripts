This is the read me file for Project 3.
I decided to work with our last lab using Flask and expand on it so I could try and use what I have learned in python and html coding and put it into one. I used the base code of web.py to use the same server and used routes.py to be able to use a similar format. I tried incorporating some of my own code to our lab to create almost a summary about me for the final project. 

We start out by having to turn on the server. Open up a terminal and run the command 
`C:\venv\flask\Scripts\activate.ps1`
Then run the command
`python .\web.py`
If you get any errors running this first check that you are on the windows vm. Second, check that you are in the correct directory which is it3038c-scripts -> flask 

Once the server is running, you can then go to a browser and type in localhost:5000
This will take you to the flask site I created. Now, you have the ability to navigate all around the website. 

To start enter in your name then select submit. This will then take you to the welcome page where you can then go further into the other pages to look at the other information I put in. There are links that you can visit as well as some forms to fill out. 

If you get any errors while navigating the site, one easy fix to try is turning ther server off and on again. If you still have any other errors look in flask\templates and find the corresponding page for a more specific solution.
